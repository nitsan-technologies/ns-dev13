# TYPO3 v13.2: On Your Mark, Get Set, Innovate!

TYPO3 is excited to announce the release of **TYPO3 v13.2** This new version brings many useful improvements for editors and some exciting technical enhancements.

## User-Friendly Updates for Editors
TYPO3 has always aimed to provide a smooth experience for backend users. Editors who use the TYPO3 backend daily need a modern, easy-to-use, and feature-rich interface. **TYPO3 v13.2** offers several improvements to make their work easier and faster.

## What's New Under the Hood
Most changes in TYPO3 v13.2 are behind the scenes. For instance, a new Schema API has been introduced to lay the groundwork for future Content Blocks integration. This makes the system more efficient and ready for future updates.

# Key Features in TYPO3 v13.2
Backend Search Improvements
TYPO3’s backend search is now more powerful. You can find search terms not only in pages and database records but also in backend modules and workspaces. Access permissions are considered during the search.

## Mass Editing of Selected Columns
Update multiple records in the backend with one action. For example, you can change the author's name for several pages at once. The new "Edit columns" button simplifies this process by showing only the fields you need to update.

## Record List Download Presets
Export data from various database tables easily with new presets. For instance, you can export a user list with specific fields like username and email, without configuring the fields manually each time.

## Form Listings
The Form Framework now allows better management of form definitions. Lists are sortable by columns, and you can only delete forms that are not in use.

## Schema API
The new Schema API helps developers work with database table configurations more efficiently. It’s a foundational feature for future Content Blocks integration.

## Self-contained Content Elements
Content elements are now more independent from rendering libraries, making the system more flexible and future-proof.

## Reference Index Updates
The reference index has been improved for better performance. This makes data retrieval faster and enhances overall system speed.

## System Requirements and Support for TYPO3 v13.2
TYPO3 v13 requires PHP version 8.2, which will be supported until December 2025. The long-term support version, TYPO3 v13 LTS, will receive bug fixes until April 2026 and security patches until October 2027.

## Download and Installation

## Looking Ahead in TYPO3 Roadmap
